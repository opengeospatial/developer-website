Introduction to OGC Standards
=================================

OGC publishes a variety of documents. The different document types include:

* Implementation Standard: These standards are specifications that provide a basis for working software. They provide the detail about the interface between software components.
* Abstract Specifications: These standards are the conceptual foundation or reference models that provide the basis for Implementation Standards.
* Best Practices: These documents describe recommended use of implementation standards.
* Engineering Reports: These documents describe the results from pilots, testbeds, interoperability experiments and other activities undertaken in the OGC Interoperability Program.
* Discussion Papers: These documents enable public review of concepts
* Change Requests: These document can be submitted at any time by anyone to formally suggest changes or improvements in OGC documents
