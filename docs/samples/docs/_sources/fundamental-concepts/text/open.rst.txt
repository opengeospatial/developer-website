Standards Development
=====================

Today, lives and property depend on digital information flowing smoothly from one information system to another. Public safety, disaster management, and military applications increasingly depend on communication between dissimilar systems. Take a moment to watch this video on a 2019 initiative OGC conducted on Disaster Resilience.

The Need
--------

No single organization produces all of the data that an industry requires and no single vendor provides all of the systems that an industry would need. Further, the systems across an organization use different system architectures, which are usually based on different proprietary interfaces. This raises the enduring need for standards to be developed to enable interoperability between the different systems. Organizations such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) engage their members in processes that define and specify standards.
