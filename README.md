# OGC Developer Website

## Introduction
This repository hosts the source of the OGC Developer Website https://developer.ogc.org

Currently, the website is served from the [gh-pages](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-website/tree/gh-pages) branch. Read [this note](#note-about-publishing-the-website), to understand how the website is generated. 

## Quick Start :rocket:

Clone this repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-website.git`

Then enter the folder:

`cd developer-website`

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Start development server:

`npm start`

Once you start the development server, the site will be available at:

`http://localhost:3000`

The hot reload will ensure that the changes you do on the code will be reflected on the browser.


### Note about Publishing the Website

Commit all your changes to the `master` branch. **The `gh-pages` branch will be wiped each time, and generated dynamically from [GitHub actions](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-website/actions/)**. Apart from copying the static build, the action will copy the `api` folder and pull remote repos that live under `developer.ogc.org`. If you need to add anything else, just edit the [workflow file](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-website/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) directly.
