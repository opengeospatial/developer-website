description: |-
  Either a date-time or an interval. Date and time expressions adhere to RFC 3339. 
  Intervals may be bounded or half-bounded (double-dots at start or end).

  Only features that have a `validTime` property that intersects the value of
  `datetime` are selected.

  If history is supported for a feature type, the following also applies:
  - if `datetime` is a time instant or `now`, only the description valid at the specified time is selected
  - if `datetime` is a time period, only the latest description valid during the period is selected
  - The response can never include more that one description of the same feature
