# UxS Data Examples

The following are examples of UxS related data records implementing the models defined during the OGC UxS interoperability experiment. Each example is composed of a schema that describes the record structure as well as the corresponding encoded data record that would be incorporated in a datastream.


## Telemetry

* [Record Schema](Telemetry_Schema.json)
* [JSON Data](Telemetry_Data.json)


## Mission

* [Record Schema](Mission_Schema.json)
* [JSON Data](Mission_Data.json)
