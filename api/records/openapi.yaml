        Imported from OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core
        See: https://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/parameters/bbox.yaml'

        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are
        selected.  The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
        depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a
        vertical axis (height or depth):
      
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
      
        If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system
        is WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/
        CRS84) unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in
        the parameter `bbox-crs`.
      
        If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system
        is WGS 84 longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.
        net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h) unless a different coordinate reference
        system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.
      
        The query parameter `bbox-crs` is specified in
        OGC API - Features - Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference.
      
        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
        of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
        latitude.  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
        first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value
        (east-most box edge).
      
        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are the
        bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.
      
        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the
        decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property
        is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.

        Either a date-time or an interval. Date and time expressions adhere to
        RFC 3339.  Intervals may be bounded or half-bounded (double-dots at
        start or end).

        Examples:

        * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
        * A bounded interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
        * Half-bounded intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or
          "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
      
        Only features that have a temporal property that intersects the value
        of `datetime` are selected.
      
        If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant temporal properties.

        The extent of the features in the collection. In the Core only spatial
        and temporal extents are specified. Extensions may add additional
        members to represent other extents, for example, thermal or pressure
        ranges.

        An array of extents is provided for each extent type (spatial,
        temporal). The first item in the array describes the overall extent of
        the data. All subsequent items describe more precise extents, e.g., to
        identify clusters of data. Clients only interested in the overall
        extent will only need to access the first extent in the array.

                In the Core only a single bounding box is supported.

                Extensions may support additional areas.
                The first bounding box describes the overall spatial
                extent of the data. All subsequent bounding boxes describe
                more precise bounding boxes, e.g., to identify clusters of data.
                Clients only interested in the overall spatial extent will

              items:
                description: |-
                  Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
                  depending on whether the coordinate reference system
                  includes a vertical axis (height or depth):

                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
      
                  If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate
                  reference system is WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.
                  opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a different
                  coordinate reference system is specified in `crs`.
      
                  If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate
                  reference system is WGS 84 longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal
                  height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
                  unless a different coordinate reference system is specified
                  in `crs`.
      
                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases
                  the sequence of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum
                  longitude and maximum latitude.  However, in cases where the
                  box spans the antimeridian the first value (west-most box
                  edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).
      
                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth
                  number are the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional
                  bounding box.
      
                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is
                  the decision of the server whether only a single spatial
                  geometry property is used to determine the extent or all
                  relevant geometries.

    Records:
      description:
        The response is a document consisting of records in the collection.
        The records included in the response are determined by the server
        based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
        larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
        paged access with links to the next page, if more records are selected
        that the page size.

        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a
        subset of the records in the collection (the records that are in the
        bounding box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all records
        in the collection that are not associated with a location, too. The
        `datetime` parameter matches all records in the collection that are
        not associated with a time stamp or interval, too.

        The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
        selected records that should be returned in the response, the page size.
        Each page may include information about the number of selected and
        returned records (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
        links to support paging (link relation `next`).
